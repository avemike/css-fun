# Hello
This project is kind of my personal CSS showcase and a place to play with my css-styling abilities.

Frankly I wanted to create something cool. Something I can show other people for which I won't have to be ashamed.

I've used React, React-router and SCSS (not vanilla css, but its main features I've utilized is nested selectors and variables).

It's CSS centred project, so I've restrained myself from using React too much and used solely its basic functionalities.

## Description of each page
1. **Glitch effect**
  - Uncomplicated glitch effect. Parent div has many children, who have set background to the same image. Then I'm using clip-path in animation and cut off part of it in particular keyframes. 
2. **Waterball animation**
  - Originally I've made this animation in Adobe XD and I've used assets from that project. Someday I'm gonna share it too.
3. **Dice**
  - Dice model 3D. Fun with _perspective_ CSS property and 3D rotating surfaces.
4. **Landscape**
  - Whole animation is made in CSS. I haven't used any external assets.
5. **Darkness**
  - Before image is div block which background is black with radial-gradient on centre. Radial-gradient is transparent.
  - I'm accomplished effect of curvy path by using two animations, one is moving along Y axis, and a second one is moving along X axis.
